# Survey form Project 

## Creating a survey form using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

### About the project 

I created a sign-up form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form includes inputs for first name, last name, phone number, email, and password, and a submit button. The form is designed using HTML and CSS. The only functionality implemented with JavaScript is the validation of the form inputs and the password. The form is responsive and interactive. This project helped me to improve my web development skills and gave me a deeper understanding of how to use JavaScript to validate form inputs and passwords.
